Project 0
This project was to learn how to overlay images of different color scales. We took real world data of separate color scale plates to make a <br></br>
full colorized image. My approach was to first crop out the white borders for easier aligning. I had two methods for aligning: the naive exhaustive <br></br>
search and the gaussian pyramid search method. The first method just takes a window of displacements and tries every one of them to see which displacement <br></br>
works the best. All of these images were aligning the green and red plates to the blue plate. The gaussian pyramid way first does a gaussian blur over <br></br>
the image and then rescales the image by half. This continues until the image is under a certain size. Then it begins trying to find the best displacement. <br></br>
The best displacement is propogated down the pyramid and is used as an estame for the next best displacement. For the photo of emir, I had to align the <br></br>
blue and red plates to the green plate.
